    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Personal Security is the protection of personal data on a device in order to prevent theft and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is protected like many valuable items such as serial numbers, alarms, doors, and locks. The protection of information in computers can be achieved through other tactics, some them very complex. Security precautions fall into four major threats: (1) theft of data, (2) vandalism, (3) fraud, and (4) invasion of privacy. The most basic means of protecting personal information is to electronically track and all the information regarding an account such as usernames, passwords, and bank details. </p>

    <h2>Who started this?
    <p> In 1975, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak released the first personal computer: the Apple I. This was when personal security took a giant leap. With the creation of personal computers came problems relating with hackers, people that want to steal personal information. This was when Data Encryption was born! Encryption is changing data so that it’s hard to decipher. It's like sending a secret message in which only you and the receiver have the ability to read it.</p>

    <h3>History and what it is</h3>
     <p>Personal security has been around for centuries. Helping to secure the personal information of people no matter if it is with technology or with the real world. </p>

    <h4>Interesting Facts</h4>
    <p>1. The computer system itself can automatically track the used of passwords, recording such data as which files were accessed and used under particular passwords.</p>
    <p>2. Data is often encrypted so that it can be deciphered only by holders of a singular encryption key.</p>
    <p>3. One security measure is to store a system’s data on a separate device, or medium, such as magnetic tape or disks, that is normally inaccessible through the computer system.</p>
    <p>4. The proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s formed the problem of hacks because they were able to illegally access major computer systems from the privacy of their homes.</p>
    
    <h5>Why does this exist, what do people gain from this?</h5>
    <p>Personal Security exists because it protects people’s personal information from being stolen from hackers. Without personal security hackers can easily steal information and use it for their own gain. The benefits from personal security is that once they create a password for an account and its saved onto a computer system, they don’t have to worry about any hackers trying to steal any information that is personal or very important. Every computer has to have some sort of security otherwise people are going to worry that their information is at risk of being stolen.</p>

    <h6>How does it affect coding or online culture</h6>
    <p>It affects coding because personal security on devices and computers protects personal information that has access to passwords, addresses, numbers, emails, and other important information. It also protects coding data because it keeps it secured so that it is not accessed by hackers or people trying to steal important information on people’s computers and devices. </p>
