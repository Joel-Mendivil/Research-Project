    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Personal Security is the protection of personal data on a device in order to prevent theft and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is protected like many valuable items such as serial numbers, alarms, doors, and locks. 
        The protection of information in computers can be achieved through other tactics, some them very complex. Security precautions fall into four major threats: (1) theft of data, (2) vandalism, (3) fraud, and (4) invasion of privacy.  
        The most basic means of protecting personal information is to electronically track and all the information regarding an account such as usernames, passwords, and bank details. </p>

    <h2>Who started this?</h2>
    <p> In 1975, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak released the first personal computer: the Apple I. This was when personal security took a giant leap. With the creation of personal computers came problems relating with hackers, people that want to steal personal information. This was when Data Encryption was born! Encryption is changing data so that it’s hard to decipher. It's like sending a secret message in which only you and the receiver have the ability to read it.</p>
