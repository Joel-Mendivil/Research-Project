    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Personal Security is the protection of personal data on a device in order to prevent theft and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is protected like many valuable items such as serial numbers, alarms, doors, and locks. The protection of information in computers can be achieved through other tactics, some them very complex. Security precautions fall into four major threats: (1) theft of data, (2) vandalism, (3) fraud, and (4) invasion of privacy. The most basic means of protecting personal information is to electronically track and all the information regarding an account such as usernames, passwords, and bank details. </p>

    <h3>Why does this exist, what do people gain from this?</h3>
    <p>Personal Security exists because it protects people’s personal information from being stolen from hackers. Without personal security hackers can easily steal information and use it for their own gain. The benefits from personal security is that once they create a password for an account and its saved onto a computer system, they don’t have to worry about any hackers trying to steal any information that is personal or very important. Every computer has to have some sort of security otherwise people are going to worry that their information is at risk of being stolen.</p>

    <h4>Interesting Facts</h4>
    <p>1. The computer system itself can automatically track the used of passwords, recording such data as which files were accessed and used under particular passwords.</p>
    <p>2. Data is often encrypted so that it can be deciphered only by holders of a singular encryption key.</p>
    <p>3. One security measure is to store a system’s data on a separate device, or medium, such as magnetic tape or disks, that is normally inaccessible through the computer system.</p>
    <p>4. The proliferation of personal computers in the 1980s formed the problem of hacks because they were able to illegally access major computer systems from the privacy of their homes.</p>
